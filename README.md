This project analyses regional adult social care (ASC) usage across England.

## Dataset
The data for this project are from the SALT (short and long term) and ASCFR (ASC activity and financereport) datasets published by NHS Digital and can be accessed here:
https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-social-care-activity-and-finance-report

The regional shape identifier geoJSON file can be downloaded from the ONS here:
https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(BDY_CTYUA)

## Map plot
ASC_MapPlot.py will plot regional differences in access to adult social care as an interactive map of the UK, that will open in your browser.

A screenshot of an example plot is shown below. The 'disparity' index represents the difference between the % of over-65s who requested access to social care, and those who received it, from 2017-2020.
